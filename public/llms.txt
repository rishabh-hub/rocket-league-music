# ReplayRhythms

> A web application that analyzes Rocket League gameplay replay files and recommends personalized music based on your unique playstyle and match statistics.

## What is ReplayRhythms?

ReplayRhythms connects your Rocket League gameplay to music. Upload a `.replay` file, and the app analyzes your stats (aggression, speed, boost usage, aerial frequency, teamwork) using the ballchasing.com API and a Python-based recommendation engine to suggest songs that match your playstyle.
